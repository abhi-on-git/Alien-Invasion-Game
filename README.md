# Alien-Invasion-Game
This is a game solely built on python 3 using pygame module. Recreation of classic Space Invaders Game.

This is a game we have all played at one point of time in our lifes and if we haven't , then please checkout my version :)

There are some aspects left such as creating different levels in the game and adding a menu screen. Please read below for details:

Adding Levels in the game:
1. Currently the game starts as soon as it is run and after the spaceship has shot all the aliens above it or an alien hits the 
ship, the game restarts from the start.
2. We need to add a level feature where if the spaceship kills all the aliens , a new level is started where all the aliens speed is increased by an arbitrary amount ( the working dev has discretion on that ).
3.If the player however dies on an 'nth' level, the game stops and reverts back to menu scree ( if added ) or reverts back to level 1.

Adding a Menu Screen:
1. As stated above the game starts as soon as it is run and that is not how production games are made. I would highly appreciate if you could add a new file into the codebase and add this feature
2.The menu should include a start button and a highscore value.
